=Tribe App Backend

This is the backend to the wonderful Tribe App.

Let's see, what can I tell you about it..

It is collaboratively produced by a bunch of people who are learning to become better developers by taking tasks,
researching and completing them, just as they would in a real job. This is called the Mock Programming Job. You can find
more about the DMPJ at our meetup page: https://www.meetup.com/denver-mock-programming-job-meetup/
